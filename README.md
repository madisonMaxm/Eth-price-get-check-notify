# Eth-price-get-check-notify

For those of us not using GDAX to invest/ trade ETH, this script serves to automate 
the process of checking prices and remove the need to obsessively manually check.

After setting user parameters in the .config file, you will be notified in your email when
the price of ETH reaches your set limit.
